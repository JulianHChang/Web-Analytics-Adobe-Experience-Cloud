# Awareness Analytics

### Brand awareness is the ultimate prize for online marketing teams, who attempt to reach broader sets of customers around the globe more frequently. Awareness is the measurement used to understand if customers are conscious of your brand, know about your company, and are familiar with its products and/or services.

## There are many ways to track brand awareness, but here is a list of the top three methods:

* Third-party providers—These companies provide market research to determine how your company measures up against its peers.
* Offline research studies—Organizations use these studies to poll broad groups of people about their familiarity with your company.
* Online analytics and tools—Using your website’s analytics to measure brand awareness is increasingly becoming the de facto method amongst marketers. You can pull information from Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn into Adobe Analytics to gain further insights about your brand.

## The following tasks will offer insight into the effectiveness of channel campaigns, keywords, and affiliates and offer direction to where you can find optimization.
