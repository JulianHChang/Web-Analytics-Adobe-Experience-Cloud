# Persuasion Analytics

### Persuasion analytics help decode the decisions of website visitors—what it was that finally convinced them to sign up/buy/register. Once you can identify which areas of your website serve as transitional checkpoints for conversion, you can better use them to your advantage. Plus, you’ll discover low-performing areas to improve.
